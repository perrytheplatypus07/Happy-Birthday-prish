        <h1>Happy Birthday Prish!!!!</h1>
        <p> Happy Birthday Prish (Itni mehnat kar li tere liye maine lmao). Now people have written poems for you but kisi ne aaj tak tere liye poori website 
            banayi hai?ðŸ˜¼ No right?ðŸ˜¼ Dekh kitna acha hoon mai dekhhh and roz ladhti rehti hai merse tu huhðŸ™„. But anyway jokes apart, HAPPIEST 22ND BIRTHDAY
            CUTIE <3. if I try to put it into words ki how much you mean to me I'll prolly go on for days but let's face it, my "comprehension skills are bad" 
            and you already know your importance in my life (itâ€™s even bigger than how big your ass is)</p>
        <p>Now since ab itni badi website bana hi di hai, let me highlight some of the best moments of our friendship.</p>

        <p>
            I think this is prolly the first photo we ever took and it was our first outing ig after we met at sanatâ€™s house. I fuckin love this photo and I 
            very clearly remember that this photo was ham dono ki whatsapp dp for some timeðŸ˜­. Itâ€™s lit so cute. Maybe cuz our faces ainâ€™t fully visible ðŸ’€.
        </p>
        <h2>Riiâ€™s 15th Birthday</h2>
        <img src="D:\Prish Birthday\rii 15th birthday.jpg" width="20%">
        <p>
            How can I ever forget this birthday cuz this is where it all startedðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€ðŸ’€(ykwim). This was the first time I came to your house and is birthday 
            ke baad hamara group bana tha where Roshit used to flirt with you and then I also started flirting ðŸ˜­ðŸ˜­ but it was indeed a memorable day ngl.
