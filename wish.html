        <h1>Happy Birthday Prish!!!!</h1>
        <p> Happy Birthday Prish (Itni mehnat kar li tere liye maine lmao). Now people have written poems for you but kisi ne aaj tak tere liye poori website 
            banayi hai?😼 No right?😼 Dekh kitna acha hoon mai dekhhh and roz ladhti rehti hai merse tu huh🙄. But anyway jokes apart, HAPPIEST 22ND BIRTHDAY
            CUTIE <3. if I try to put it into words ki how much you mean to me I'll prolly go on for days but let's face it, my "comprehension skills are bad" 
            and you already know your importance in my life (it’s even bigger than how big your ass is)</p>
        <p>Now since ab itni badi website bana hi di hai, let me highlight some of the best moments of our friendship.</p>
        <h2>First Photo</h2>
        <img src="first photo.jpg" width="40%">
        <p>
            I think this is prolly the first photo we ever took and it was our first outing ig after we met at sanat’s house. I fuckin love this photo and I 
            very clearly remember that this photo was ham dono ki whatsapp dp for some time😭. It’s lit so cute. Maybe cuz our faces ain’t fully visible 💀.
        </p>
        <h2>Rii’s 15th Birthday</h2>
        <img src="rii 15th birthday.jpg" width="40%">
        <p>
            How can I ever forget this birthday cuz this is where it all started💀💀💀💀💀(ykwim). This was the first time I came to your house and is birthday 
            ke baad hamara group bana tha where Roshit used to flirt with you and then I also started flirting 😭😭 but it was indeed a memorable day ngl.
        </p>
        <h2>Your 19th Birthday</h2>
        <img src="prish 19th birthday.jpg" width="40%">
        <p>
            I still clearly remember the planning I did for your birthday. Mumma ke through maine apne kapde Sanat ke ghar bhijvaaye, bunked last 2 periods of 
            college and AND AND how you stopped talking to everyone on 6th October and we were seriously contemplating if we should come surprise you or not💀
        </p>
        <h2>Santa and Saras’ Birthday</h2>
        <img src="first nightstay aka sanat saras' birthday.jpg" width="40%">
        <p>
            I fuckin love this photo. This photo lit has my heart. Ofc we can’t forget sanat and saras’ birthday because that was the first nightstay we did 
            and Santa twerked for us😭😭😭😭😭 but most importantly, we became best friends us time and November 2021 was the best month of 2021 for me cuz 
            we both got close us month mei.
        </p>
        <h2>Uncle’s 50th Birthday</h2>
        <img src="uncle's 50th birthday.jpg" width="40%">
        <p>
            How can I ever forget this birthday cuz this is where it all started💀💀💀💀💀(ykwim). This was the first time I came to your house and is birthday 
            ke baad hamara group bana tha where Roshit used to flirt with you and then I also started flirting 😭😭 but it was indeed a memorable day ngl.
        </p>
        <h2>Roshu’s 16th birthday</h2>
        <img src="roshu's birthday.jpg" width="40%">
        <p>
            This birthday was also cute cuz we got so many good photos is birthday pr
        </p>
        <h2>My 19th Birthday</h2>
        <img src="my 19th birthday.jpg" width="40%">
        <p>
            My 19th birthday was so far my best birthday because that day was just 🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻🤌🏻. I remember that we went to MKT and I made y’all wait for 2 hours 
            just so we all could eat at AMA but I think the wait was def worth it cuz you LOVED vaha ke chicken fries and then we went to mere ghar and I think 
            that was the first time you cane to my house. 
        </p>
        <h2>NYE 2022</h2>
        <img src="NYE 2022.jpg" width="40%">
        <p>
            This was by far the ‘best nightstay’ according to you and I couldn’t agree more (even tho sanat saras’ birthday vaala nightstay is the best one for me) 
            but yes, we had A LOT of fun and I remember I was sad is stay pr cuz I had a fight with my friends but my mood eventually got better with ‘you’ guys
        </p>
        <h2>NYE 2023</h2>
        <img src="NYE 2023.jpg" width="40%">
        <p>
            Again this stay is special because we sneaked uncle logo ki daaru and got drunk😭😭😭 and I remember how we all played UNO at night and had 
            bohot zyada fun.
        </p>
        <h2>The CP outing💀</h2>
        <img src="CP Outing.jpg" width="40%">
        <p>
            Yeah you clearly know which one I am referring to💀 this outing was definitely something. But jokes apart, I genuinely miss that day because it 
            was actually fun and would actually want to go back and live this day again
        </p>
        <h2>SHREYA GHOSHALLL</h2>
        <img src="shreya ghoshal concert.jpg" width="40%">
        <p>
            I absolutely love this photo, it’s so cute😭. This concert was def something and I remember how we all went bonkers when she sang Chikni Chameli
        </p>
        <h2>17th March, 2024 - The ‘non-date date’</h2>
        <img src="17th March.jpg" width="40%">
        <p>
            Yeah idc what you think but this was a date. But jokes aside, I still remember this day because it was so cute?? Riyaana asked if she could come 
            with us and you stricly said NO😭😭😭. It was a perfect day from every possible way and I would love to go in past and live this day again.
        </p>
        <h2>Plane spotting ‘date'</h2>
        <img src="plane spotting.jpg" width="40%">
        <p>
            Ya this day is cute too because we made an impromptu plan to meet and it accidentally turned into a date😭. I clearly remember how I was guessing 
            the model of the plane and somehow it was always correct??😭😭. Truth be told, even I was guessing and I wasn’t sure but my luck was working that 
            day and I was able to guess everything correctly 😭😭😭😭
        </p>
        <p>
            We’ve def had some crazy moments together and would love to create more memories with you.
            <br>Once again, happiest birthday Prishu, I love you so fuckin much<3
            <br>Love,
            <br>Buttocks
